# Project Description:
 Apply machine learning algorithm to predict the molecular subtypes of breast cancer based on mammography images. This is obtained by processing labeled images in Dicom format, then features are extracted using GLCM. Finally, two different machine-learning models are trained -->
Logistic Regression and RandomForestRegressor. 
## Data Source Used: 
[The Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD)](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70230508)
